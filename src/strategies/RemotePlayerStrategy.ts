/**
 * Remote Player Strategy
 *
 * Represents a human player on another device.
 * Actions arrive via WebRTC DataChannel from opponent's browser.
 *
 * CRITICAL: This follows the strategy pattern - NEVER check player.type.
 * Remote players are functionally identical to local humans from the game engine's perspective.
 *
 * Philosophy: The network is just another input source, like mouse/keyboard.
