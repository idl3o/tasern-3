---

## 🎮 How It Works

### Complete Flow

```
1. User connects wallet → WalletConnect (RainbowKit)
2. NFTGallery detects connection
3. UniversalImpactScanner.scanWalletForImpactAssets(address)
   ├─ Fetches NFTs via Alchemy API
   ├─ For each NFT:
   │  ├─ Check contract for DDD/axlREGEN/LP holdings
   │  ├─ Detect EIP-1167 proxy pattern
   │  ├─ If proxy: extract implementation, scan that too
   │  ├─ Calculate enhancement level (0-5 stars)
   │  └─ Generate stat multipliers
   └─ Returns EnhancedNFTData[]
4. enhancedNFTsToCards() converts to playable cards
5. UI displays cards with:
   - NFT badge (purple)
   - LP enhancement badge (gold, with stars)
   - Provenance badges (verified, from James, etc.)
   - Stat tooltips showing LP holdings and multipliers
```

### The Revolutionary Formula

```typescript
// Each 0.01 LP = +5% to all stats
const lpBonus = lpBalance * 100; // Convert to percentage points
const bonusPercentage = lpBonus * 5; // 5% per 0.01 LP
const multiplier = 1 + (bonusPercentage / 100);

// Example: 0.05 LP holdings
// → 0.05 * 100 = 5 percentage points
// → 5 * 5 = 25% bonus
// → 1 + 0.25 = 1.25x multiplier
// → A 10 attack card becomes 12.5 attack
```

- No errors, graceful handling

---

## 📊 Expected Results

### With LP Holdings
```
Found 5 NFTs
💎 2 NFTs with LP enhancements

Card 1: "Ser Bramble"
- Base stats: 5 ATK, 10 HP, 2 DEF
- LP Holdings: 0.05 LP
- Bonus: +25%
- Final stats: 6 ATK, 12 HP, 2 DEF
- Badge: "⭐⭐⭐ LP Enhanced"

Card 2: "Guards of Kardov"
- Base stats: 4 ATK, 8 HP, 3 DEF
- LP Holdings: 0.02 LP
- Bonus: +10%
- Final stats: 4 ATK, 8 HP, 3 DEF
- Badge: "⭐⭐ LP Enhanced"
```

### Without LP Holdings
```
Found 3 NFTs
💎 0 NFTs with LP enhancements

All cards show base stats from metadata/rarity defaults
No LP enhancement badges
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No NFTs found" but wallet has NFTs
**Solution**: Check Alchemy API key in `.env`
```bash
REACT_APP_ALCHEMY_API_KEY=demo # Replace with real key
```

### Issue: Scan fails with RPC errors
**Solution**: Rate limit hit. Scanner already handles batching, but for high-volume wallets:
- Reduce `MAX_BLOCKS_TO_SCAN` in `transactionScanner.ts`
- Add delay between NFT scans in `universalImpactScanner.ts`

### Issue: LP holdings not detected
**Causes**:
1. NFT contract doesn't hold LP tokens directly
2. Proxy pattern not EIP-1167 compliant
3. LP tokens in different contract not scanned

**Debug**:
```typescript
// Check console logs for:
"✅ NFT_NAME: Found X.XXXXXX total impact assets" // Success
"Error checking direct holdings..." // Contract issue
"Error extracting proxy implementation..." // Non-standard proxy
```

### Issue: Cards have wrong stats
**Verify formula**:
```typescript
const lpBonusPercentage = (statMultiplier - 1) * 100;
// Example: 1.25x multiplier
// → (1.25 - 1) * 100 = 25% bonus ✅
```

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

### Before Production Launch

1. **Get Production Alchemy API Key**
   - Sign up at https://www.alchemy.com
   - Create Polygon app
   - Add key to `.env.production`

2. **Verify Contract Addresses**
   - All addresses confirmed on Polygon mainnet ✅
   - LP contract tested and validated ✅

3. **Test with Real Wallets**
   - Connect wallet with known Tasern NFTs
   - Verify LP discovery works end-to-end
   - Check stat calculations are correct

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Scanner batches requests (1000 blocks per batch)
   - Progress callbacks prevent UI freezing
   - Logs limited to last 5 for performance

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions

## 🔒 Wallet-Specific NFT Cards (PVP Support)

### Implementation (2025-10-09 Update)

NFT cards are now **wallet-specific** to support true PVP gameplay!

#### How It Works

**Storage (`src/state/nftCardsStore.ts`)**:
```typescript
interface NFTCardsState {
  // Map of wallet address -> NFT cards
  nftCardsByWallet: Record<string, Card[]>;

  setNFTCards: (walletAddress: string, cards: Card[]) => void;
  getNFTCards: (walletAddress: string | undefined) => Card[];
  clearNFTCards: (walletAddress?: string) => void;
}
```

**Key Features**:
- Each wallet has its own isolated NFT card collection
- Cards keyed by lowercase wallet address for consistency
- Safe for PVP - Player 1's NFTs won't appear in Player 2's deck
- Disconnecting wallet clears that wallet's cards only

**NFT Scanning (`src/components/NFTGallery.tsx`)**:
```typescript
// Save cards with wallet address
setNFTCards(walletAddress, playableCards);

// Clear specific wallet on disconnect
setNFTCards(account, []);
```

**Deck Selection (`src/App.tsx`)**:
```typescript
const { getNFTCards } = useNFTCardsStore();
const { address: walletAddress } = useAccount();

// Get NFT cards for currently connected wallet only
const nftCards = getNFTCards(walletAddress);
```

#### PVP Scenarios

**Human vs AI**:
- Human uses NFT cards from their connected wallet ✅
- AI generates cards dynamically (no wallet needed) ✅

**Human vs Human (Local)**:
- Current: Both players share same wallet's NFT cards
- Reason: Only one wallet can be connected at a time in browser
- Future: Player 2 could connect their wallet before deck selection

**Human vs Human (Remote/Multiplayer)**:
- Each player connects their own wallet on their own device ✅
- NFT cards isolated by wallet address ✅
- No crossover - perfectly wallet-gated ✅

#### Console Logging
```
🎴 Available NFT cards for current wallet: 3
💳 Wallet connected: 0x1234...5678
💾 Saved 3 NFT cards for wallet 0x1234...5678
```
