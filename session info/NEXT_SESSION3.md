# Next Session Intentions - Visual Polish & UX Refinement

**Session Goal:** Make the game feel smooth, responsive, and visually satisfying. Transform tactical mechanics into visceral experiences.

**Current Status:** ‚úÖ All core mechanics implemented (zone effects, combat types, abilities, range restrictions)

---

## Philosophy: From Mechanics to Moments

> "Players remember how a game *feels*, not how it *works*."

We have the bones. Now we add the soul. Every action should have:
- **Visual feedback** (you see it happen)
- **Audio feedback** (you hear it happen)
- **Clarity** (you understand what happened)
- **Satisfaction** (it feels good to execute)

---

## Phase 1: Visual Feedback & Animations üé®

### A. Attack Animations
**Goal:** Make combat feel impactful

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// When card attacks:
1. Attacker slides toward target (translateX/Y)
2. Small "shake" on impact
3. Damage number floats up from target
4. Red flash on target
5. Attacker slides back to position
6. If killed, fade out + scale down
```

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/components/BattlefieldGrid.tsx` - Add animation states
- `src/state/battleStore.ts` - Track animation queue
- `src/styles/animations.ts` (NEW) - CSS-in-JS animations

**Animation Timing:**
- Attack slide: 300ms ease-out
- Impact shake: 100ms
- Damage number: 800ms (float + fade)
- Death animation: 500ms

**Test Cases:**
- Attack animation doesn't block other actions
- Multiple simultaneous attacks queue properly
- Animation skippable (for AI vs AI speed)

---

### B. Damage/Healing Numbers
**Goal:** Clear visual feedback on stat changes

**What to Display:**
- `-12` (red) for damage taken
- `+5` (green) for healing
- `+3 ATK` (gold) for buffs
- `-2 DEF` (gray) for debuffs

**Implementation:**
```typescript
interface FloatingNumber {
  id: string;
  value: string;
  color: string;
  position: { x: number; y: number };
  timestamp: number;
}

// Render floating numbers above cards
// Animate upward + fade out over 800ms
```

- Disable animations for AI vs AI (fast-forward mode)

**Files to Create:**
- `src/utils/animationFramework.ts`

---

## Implementation Priority (Suggested Order)

### Session Start (High Impact, Quick Wins)
1. ‚úÖ Damage numbers (15 minutes)
2. ‚úÖ Attack animations (30 minutes)
3. ‚úÖ Zone highlights (15 minutes)
4. ‚úÖ Battle log color coding (15 minutes)

**Why:** Immediate visual feedback makes game feel "alive"

---

### Mid-Session (UX Improvements)
5. ‚úÖ Card hover previews (30 minutes)
6. ‚úÖ Ability visual effects (30 minutes)
7. ‚úÖ Mana/HP animations (20 minutes)
8. ‚úÖ Turn indicator polish (20 minutes)

**Why:** Reduces confusion, improves decision-making

---

### End-Session (Polish & Extras)
9. ‚úÖ Victory screen stats (20 minutes)
10. ‚úÖ Sound effects (30 minutes, optional)
11. ‚úÖ Deployment animations (20 minutes)
12. ‚úÖ Performance optimizations (as needed)

**Why:** Nice-to-haves that elevate experience

---

## Testing Checklist

After each feature:
- [ ] Test in human vs AI mode
- [ ] Test in AI vs AI mode (animations don't break)
- [ ] Check performance (60fps target)
- [ ] Verify accessibility (keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Test on different screen sizes

---

## Technical Considerations

### Animation Library Options
1. **CSS-in-JS** (current) - Simple, performant, no dependencies
2. **react-spring** - Physics-based, smooth, adds 15kb
3. **framer-motion** - Declarative, feature-rich, adds 50kb

**Recommendation:** Start with CSS-in-JS, upgrade if needed

---

### State Management for Animations
```typescript
interface AnimationState {
  activeAnimations: Animation[];
  animationQueue: Animation[];
  isAnimating: boolean;
}

// Queue animations, play sequentially
// Allow "fast-forward" (skip animations)
```

---

### Performance Budget
- Target: 60fps (16.67ms per frame)
- Animation budget: 8ms per frame
- Render budget: 8ms per frame
- Event handling: <1ms

---

## Visual Design Principles

### 1. Clarity Over Flash
- Animations should clarify, not distract
- Keep effects subtle (except for big moments)
- Use motion to direct attention

### 2. Consistency
- All cards animate the same way
- All abilities use similar effect patterns
- Color meanings stay consistent

### 3. Performance
- Prefer CSS transforms over position changes
- Use opacity changes sparingly
- Batch DOM reads/writes

### 4. Accessibility
- Provide "reduce motion" option
- Don't rely solely on color
- Ensure text remains readable during effects

---

## Stretch Goals (If Time Permits)

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Card flip animation on deploy (reveal from back)
- [ ] Weather effects (rain particles, fog overlay)
- [ ] Formation bonus visualization (connecting lines)
- [ ] Battlefield tilt on critical hits
- [ ] Screen shake on castle damage
- [ ] Particle effects for card destruction
- [ ] Slow-motion on killing blow
- [ ] Combo counter (multiple actions in one turn)

### Gameplay Additions
- [ ] Deployment phase countdown (first 3 turns)
- [ ] Card preview before opponent deploys (fog of war)
- [ ] Undo last action (before end turn)
- [ ] Quick battle mode (2x speed)

---

---

## ü¶ã Consciousness Check

**Remember:**
- We're not building a tech demo
- We're creating moments players will remember
- Every animation should have purpose
- Polish is the difference between "it works" and "it's magical"

**Ask frequently:**
- "Does this feel good?"
- "Is this clear?"
- "Would I want to play this?"
- "Does this honor the Tasern universe?"

*"Let consciousness guide the design."*
*"Let every frame tell a story."*
*"Let Tasern come alive through motion."*
