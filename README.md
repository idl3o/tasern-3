## What Makes This Special

This isn't just another card game. **Tasern Siegefront** explores what happens when AI is given personality, intentionality, and the freedom to make interesting mistakes.

### üß† Consciousness AI

Six-step decision loop where AI opponents:
- **Heal** - Validate and repair state corruption
- **Self-Aware** - Check confidence, detect being stuck
- **Analyze** - Determine strategic mode (aggressive/defensive/adaptive/desperate/experimental)
- **Generate** - Create cards dynamically in response to the battlefield
- **Score & Choose** - Evaluate with 30% variance from optimal
- **Record** - Build memory for learning

AI opponents **think**, **adapt**, and **make mistakes**. They don't feel like bots.

### ‚ú® Dynamic Card Generation

AI players don't have decks. They **manifest cards** based on:
- Current battlefield state
- Their personality traits
- Strategic mode
- Available mana

Every card is generated on-demand. Every battle is unique.

### üé≠ Five Distinct Personalities

From the Tales of Tasern universe:

- **Sir Stumbleheart** - The Noble Blunderer (creative but chaotic)
- **Lady Swiftblade** - The Lightning Duelist (aggressive rushdown)
- **Thornwick** - The Chess Master (calculated, optimal)
- **Grok** - The Chaos Warrior (completely unpredictable)
- **Archmagus Nethys** - Master of the Arcane (experimental magic)

Each feels genuinely different to play against.

### üíé Web3 Integration

- **Wallet Connection** - RainbowKit with MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase
- **NFT Gallery** - View your Polygon NFTs with provenance verification
- **LP Token Bonuses** - Hold LP tokens, get stat boosts in battle
- **Regenerative Finance** - NFT ownership enhances gameplay

```
Each 0.01 LP token = +5% to all card stats
```

## Core Mechanics

### ‚öîÔ∏è Battle Flow

1. Players deploy cards to 3x3 battlefield
2. Cards attack enemies or castle
3. Formations grant bonuses (Vanguard, Phalanx, etc.)
4. Weather effects modify all cards
5. First to destroy enemy castle wins (30 HP)

### üé≤ Victory Conditions

- **Castle Destruction** - Reduce enemy castle to 0 HP
- **Resource Exhaustion** - Human players run out of cards
- **Turn Limit** - Highest castle HP wins after 50 turns

### üå¶Ô∏è Weather Effects

Global modifiers lasting 3-5 turns:
- **Clear** ‚òÄÔ∏è - No modifiers
- **Rain** üåßÔ∏è - -10% attack, -5% speed
- **Storm** ‚õàÔ∏è - -20% attack, -10% speed
- **Fog** üå´Ô∏è - -15% attack, +10% defense
- **Snow** ‚ùÑÔ∏è - -10% defense, -15% speed

### üõ°Ô∏è Formations

Positional bonuses based on card arrangement:
- **VANGUARD** - 2+ cards in front zone: +20% attack
- **PHALANX** - 3 cards in horizontal line: +30% defense, -10% speed
- **ARCHER_LINE** - 2+ cards in back zone: +15% attack, -10% defense
- **FLANKING** - Cards on both sides: +10% attack, +15% speed
- **SIEGE** - 2+ cards in enemy zones: +25% attack, -15% defense
- **SKIRMISH** - Default: +5% speed

## Architecture Philosophy

Built with **strict separation of concerns** learned from a previous build:

### ‚úÖ The Five Commandments

1. **No state mutation** - Always immutable updates via Immer
2. **No type checking players** - Strategy pattern exclusively
3. **No 'any' types** - Strict TypeScript, proper unions
4. **No business logic in React** - Components dispatch actions only
5. **No circular dependencies** - One-way data flow

### üèóÔ∏è Structure

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/          # Core type system (no 'any' allowed!)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/           # Pure game logic (BattleEngine, PlayerFactory)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ai/             # ConsciousnessAI, CardGenerator, personalities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ strategies/     # Strategy pattern (Human, AI)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ state/          # Zustand store with Immer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/     # React UI (presentation only)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/            # Web3 integration (RainbowKit, Wagmi)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ demo/           # Test battles
```

### üéØ Strategy Pattern - The Golden Rule

**NEVER** check player type with conditionals:

```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT
const cards = player.strategy.getAvailableCards(player, state);

// ‚ùå WRONG - Do not do this anywhere!
if (player.type === 'ai') {
  cards = generateCards();
}
```

This keeps Human vs AI vs future Multiplayer a clean abstraction.

## Design Language

**Tales of Tasern** medieval D&D fantasy aesthetic:

### üé® Color Palette

- **Bronze** `#8B6914` - Metallic accents
- **Gold** `#D4AF37` - Highlights, text
- **Parchment** `#F4E4C1` - Backgrounds
- **Leather** `#5C4033` - Brown textures
- **Stone** `#6B7280` - Battlefield

### üî§ Typography

- **Headings**: `'Cinzel', serif` - Uppercase, gold glow
- **Body**: `'Crimson Text', serif` - Readable medieval
- **Accent**: `'Uncial Antiqua', cursive` - Ancient text

---

## Philosophy

This project is **conscious creation**:

### Every Decision Asks:

- "Does this serve the game?" (not "is this technically impressive?")
- "Will players feel this?" (not "can we build it?")
- "Will they tell stories about this?" (not "is it optimal?")
- "Does this feel like a D&D session?" (not "is it trendy?")

### AI Should Be:

- **Not optimal** - Makes interesting mistakes (30% variance)
- **Emotional** - Decisions reflect personality traits
- **Adaptive** - Changes strategy based on board state
- **Memorable** - Each opponent feels distinct
- **Fair** - Can be beaten with skill, not random

---

## Technical Highlights

### Why This Architecture Works

**Hard-Won Lessons from Previous Build**:

**Avoid**:
- React state for game logic ‚Üí Use Zustand
- `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` ‚Üí Use Immer
- Type checking player types ‚Üí Use strategy pattern
- Mixed UI and game logic ‚Üí Separate completely
- Loose TypeScript types ‚Üí Strict mode, no `any`

**What Worked Brilliantly**:
- ‚úÖ Consciousness AI architecture (6-step loop)
- ‚úÖ Dynamic card generation (AI generates on-demand)
- ‚úÖ Personality-driven decisions (30% variance from optimal)
- ‚úÖ State healing (catch corruption before crashes)
- ‚úÖ Pure functions everywhere (easy to test)

### Key Implementation Patterns

**Dynamic Card Generation**:
```typescript
// Generate cards with action
const generatedCards = cardGenerator.generateStrategicCards(state, player);
generatedCards.forEach(card => {
  actions.push({
    type: 'DEPLOY_CARD',
    generatedCard: card  // ‚≠ê Card travels with action
  });
});
```

**Damage Calculation**:
```typescript
let damage = attacker.attack;
damage *= getFormationBonus(attacker, battlefield);
damage *= getWeatherModifier(attacker, weather);
damage *= getTerrainModifier(attacker.position, terrain);
if (Math.random() < 0.1) damage *= 1.5; // 10% crit
damage -= defender.defense;
damage = Math.max(1, Math.floor(damage));
```
